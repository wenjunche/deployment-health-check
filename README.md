# OpenFin Service Deployment Health Check

A sample page to show health of some webservices deployed at OpenFin.

## Files

- urls.json: metadata for webservices, including URLs. CORS needs to be enabled for any endpoint in order for health check to work properly.
- pinger.js: performs health checks with `fetch` API for all URLs listed in urls.json.
- styles.css: CSS styles
- index.html: main page.

An example of this page is available [here](https://cdn.openfin.co/health/deployment/index.html).

This page can also be used to check health of manifest URLs by passing `?manifest=manifest_url`. Here is an [example](https://cdn.openfin.co/health/deployment/index.html?manifest=https://cdn.openfin.co/process-manager/app.json) for checking health of the manifest for OpenFin process manager.
